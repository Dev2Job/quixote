Quixote
=======

Quixote is a framework for developing Web applications in Python.
The target is web applications that are developed and maintained by
Python programmers.  See http://www.quixote.ca/users for a list of
applications using Quixote.

Quixote requires Python 2.3 or greater to run.  For installation
instructions, see the doc/INSTALL.txt file.

Quixote includes PTL, the Python Template Language for producing
HTML with Python code.  Note that the use of PTL is not required in
Quixote applications.  Details about PTL are provided in
doc/PTL.txt.
